# Sunrise and Sunset Times Visualization

A collection of scripts that gather and visualize data on sunrise and sunset times throughout the year. The data is specific to Calgary, Alberta, but future modifications will allow users to input their own location and timezone.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main parts:

1. **Data Collection Script**: This script collects data on sunrise and sunset times from a reliable source for all days of 2023. It takes about 10 minutes to run and create the sun_data.py file.

2. **Data File**: This is a python file that stores the collected data as a nested dictionary. Each entry represents one day and contains the date, sunrise time, and sunset time. Other information is also in the dictionary but it is not used for the visualization.

3. **Visualization Script**: This script reads the data from the data file and creates a scatter plot of sunrise and sunset times throughout the year. The x-axis represents the date and the y-axis represents the time of day. The plot also includes vertical lines indicating the start and end of daylight saving time.

## Future Work

In the future, I'll modify the scripts to prompt the user for their location and timezone when collecting the data and save this location and timezone information to a .env file. This will allow the plot to reflect sunrise and sunset times for any location and timezone, not just Calgary, Alberta MST.

## How to Run

To run the data collection script, use the following command. It takes about 12 minutes to gather all the information and write it out to disk. This only needs to happen once:

```bash
python data_collection.py
```

Then create the visualization with :

```bash
python visualization.py
```
